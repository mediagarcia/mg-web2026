# Media Garcia Copy Polish Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall Copy Quality: 7.5/10**

The copy is strong in several areas—clear value propositions, consistent messaging about platform-agnosticism, and solid social proof. However, there are opportunities to tighten language, eliminate buzzwords, strengthen some weaker headlines, and ensure consistency across all pages.

### Key Strengths
1. **Clear positioning**: "Platform-agnostic" messaging is well-established
2. **Strong specificity**: Numbers and metrics are used effectively (200+, 14+, 98%)
3. **Good social proof**: Testimonials are authentic and varied
4. **Consistent brand voice**: Direct, confident tone throughout

### Priority Issues to Fix
1. **CTA inconsistency**: Multiple different CTAs compete for attention
2. **Some weak/generic headlines**: A few headlines could apply to any agency
3. **Buzzword usage**: Several instances of "seamless," "transform," "solutions"
4. **Redundant copy**: Same claims repeated across multiple sections
5. **Missing proof points**: Some claims lack supporting evidence

## Phase 1: Voice & Tone Audit

### Voice Consistency Check

| Attribute | Target | Current Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Confident | Strong confidence without arrogance | ✅ Good | "We've done this 200+ times" approach used consistently |
| Direct | Get to the point | ⚠️ Mostly good | Some sections have throat-clearing |
| Human | Real, not corporate | ✅ Good | Contractions used, conversational |
| Expert | Show expertise naturally | ✅ Good | Specificity demonstrates knowledge |

### Voice Inconsistencies Found

1. **About Page vs Homepage**: About page is slightly more formal than homepage
2. **Services Page**: More feature-focused than benefit-focused in places
3. **FAQ answers**: Could be more conversational in some responses

### Words to Eliminate/Replace

| Current Word | Location | Replace With |
|--------------|----------|--------------|
| "seamless" | Services page (CRM Migration), Case studies | "with zero data loss" or "without disruption" |
| "transform" | Contact section, CTABanner, Services CTA | "improve" / "fix" / "build" |
| "leveraging" | Not found | N/A - Good! |
| "solutions" | Industries section ("solutions for IT companies") | "systems" or remove |
| "cutting-edge" | Not found | N/A - Good! |
| "robust" | Not found | N/A - Good! |
| "comprehensive" | FAQ answer | "detailed" or just remove |

### Sentences Starting with "We" - Review Needed

The copy overuses "We" as sentence starters. Examples to vary:

| Current | Suggested Revision |
|---------|-------------------|
| "We build and run digital platforms..." (Footer) | "Digital platforms that keep companies lean, growing..." |
| "We design RevOps and automation platforms..." (Hero) | Good as is - it's the main value prop |
| "We specialize in organizations where..." (Industries) | "Our focus: organizations where..." |
| "We recommend the platform that fits..." | "You get the platform that fits..." |

## Phase 3: CTA Audit

### All CTAs Catalogued

| Location | Current CTA | Type | Issue | Revised CTA |
|----------|-------------|------|-------|-------------|
| Hero Primary | "Book a Strategy Call" | Primary | ✅ Good, action-oriented | Keep |
| Hero Secondary | "See Our Results" | Secondary | ✅ Good | Keep |
| Nav Header | "Book a Strategy Call" | Primary | Consistent with hero | Keep |
| CTABanner Primary | "Get Your Free Audit" | Primary | ⚠️ Inconsistent with others | "Book a Strategy Call" or clarify audit vs call |
| CTABanner Secondary | "Call Us Now" | Secondary | ✅ Good, direct | Keep |
| About Final CTA | "Book a Strategy Call" | Primary | ✅ Consistent | Keep |
| Services Page CTA | "Book a Strategy Call" | Primary | ✅ Consistent | Keep |
| Contact Page | "Send My Request" | Form submit | ✅ Good | Keep |
| Contact Page | "Book a Meeting with Louis" | Secondary | ✅ Good, personal | Keep |
| Contact Section | "Send My Request" | Form submit | ✅ Consistent | Keep |
| Footer | "Subscribe" | Newsletter | ✅ Good | Keep |
| Work Page | CTABanner component | Inherited | Uses "Get Your Free Audit" | Align with main CTA |

### CTA Inconsistency Issue

**Problem**: Two competing primary CTAs:
1. "Book a Strategy Call" (used in Hero, Nav, About)
2. "Get Your Free Audit" (used in CTABanner)

**Recommendation**: Pick one primary action. Since "Book a Strategy Call" is more used and aligns with the human, consultative brand, make this the primary CTA everywhere. The audit can be mentioned in supporting copy, not as the button text.

### CTA Descriptors Audit

| Location | Current Descriptor | Issue | Revised |
|----------|-------------------|-------|---------|
| Hero | "30 minutes with a senior strategist. No commitment." | ✅ Excellent | Keep |
| CTABanner | "Takes 24 hours. You'll get a detailed report." | ⚠️ Implies different action | Align with strategy call |
| About CTA | "30 minutes. No commitment." | ✅ Good | Keep |
| Services CTA | "30 minutes. Platform-agnostic advice." | ✅ Good variation | Keep |

---

## Phase 4: Proof & Specificity Audit

### Claims and Evidence Matching

| Claim | Location | Proof Present? | Action Needed |
|-------|----------|----------------|---------------|

| "14+ years" | Multiple | ✅ Yes | None |
| "98% retention" | Multiple | ✅ Yes | None |
| "10+ countries" | About, Stats | ✅ Yes, countries listed | None |
| "50+ five-star reviews" | Hero, Work | ⚠️ Mentioned but not linked | Add link to review source |
| "Platinum HubSpot Partner" | Hero, About | ✅ Yes with badge | None |
| "$4M+ revenue attributed" | Work page | ⚠️ No context | Add "for clients" or remove |
| "26+ certifications" | About | ✅ Listed | None |
| "3+ year average client tenure" | About | ⚠️ Claim but no reinforcement | Cross-reference with 98% retention |
| "Senior-level expertise" | About, Hero | ⚠️ Claim | Back up with team credentials |
| "Founder involved in every engagement" | About | ✅ Good, specific | None |

### Vague Claims to Make Specific

| Vague | Location | Specific Version |
|-------|----------|------------------|
| "industry-specific workflows" | Services | "HIPAA-compliant workflows, EHR integrations, trial conversion funnels" |
| "best practices" | Services | Already specific in most places |
| "compliance considerations" | Services | Good - HIPAA is mentioned |
| "exceptional results" | Testimonial | Keep - it's a quote |

## Phase 5: Page-by-Page Edits

### Homepage

#### Hero Section
**Current pain hook**: "Tired of CRM investments that gather dust?"
**Assessment**: Strong, specific pain point. Keep.

**Current subheadline**: "We design RevOps and automation platforms for healthcare, IT, and SaaS companies—across HubSpot, Salesforce, and custom stacks."
**Issue**: Long and information-dense
**Revised**: Keep as is—it's the core positioning and works.

#### Services Section
**Current**: "From CRM strategy to automation build-out, we deliver end-to-end RevOps solutions that transform how you attract, engage, and close."

**Issues**:
- "solutions" - buzzword
- "transform" - overused
- "end-to-end" - could be more specific

**Revised**: "From CRM strategy to automation build-out, we design RevOps systems that improve how you attract, engage, and close."

#### Process Section
**Current headline**: "A proven process for results"

**Issue**: Generic

**Revised headline**: "Discovery to launch in 4 stages"

**Current description**: "Platform-agnostic methodology that ensures every implementation is strategic, efficient, and built to scale."

**Issue**: "ensures" is soft, "built to scale" is vague

**Revised**: "A platform-agnostic approach that keeps every implementation strategic, efficient, and ready to grow with you."

### About Page

#### Hero Subheadline
**Current**: "We're obsessed with your outcomes, not our billable hours. That's why healthcare, IT, and SaaS companies choose us—and stay for years."

**Assessment**: Excellent. Direct, specific, differentiated. Keep.

#### Who We Are Section - Paragraph 2
**Current**: "For 14+ years, we've stayed deliberately small. No junior staff learning on your dime. No account managers who disappear after the sale. Our founder is involved in every engagement, and our team brings senior-level expertise from day one."

**Issue**: "senior-level expertise" is vague

**Revised**: "For 14+ years, we've stayed deliberately small. No junior staff learning on your dime. No account managers who disappear after the sale. Our founder is involved in every engagement, and our team has 26+ HubSpot certifications across every hub."

#### Team Section Headline
**Current**: "Meet the people behind the work"

**Issue**: Generic

**Revised**: "A team you'll actually work with"

#### Recognition Section Headline
**Current**: "Certified expertise, proven results"

**Issue**: Two buzzwords in a row

**Revised**: "26+ certifications across every HubSpot hub"

### Services Page

#### Page Header
**Current**: "Find the right service for your business"

**Issue**: Generic, applies to any service company

**Revised**: "Revenue services for complex sales cycles"

#### CRM Migration Description
**Current**: "Seamless data migration from your current CRM with zero data loss and minimal disruption."

**Issue**: "Seamless" is a buzzword

**Revised**: "Data migration from your current CRM with zero data loss and minimal disruption."

#### Platform Section Copy
**Current**: "During discovery, we'll assess your requirements and suggest the best fit. Already have a platform? We'll make it work better for your team."

**Assessment**: Good, direct, customer-focused. Keep.

### Contact Page

**Current description**: "Ready to streamline your operations and accelerate revenue? Tell us about your goals and we'll show you how we can help."

**Issues**:
- "streamline" is corporate-speak
- "accelerate" is buzzword-adjacent

**Revised**: "Tell us about your goals and we'll show you what's possible."

### Work Page (Case Studies)

#### Page Header
**Current**: "Results that speak for themselves"

**Issue**: Cliché

**Revised**: "Real numbers from real clients"

### FAQ Section

#### Headline

## Phase 6: Terminology Consistency

### Terms to Standardize

| Inconsistent Usage | Standardize To | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| "CRM" vs "revenue systems" | Use both appropriately | "CRM" for technical discussions, "revenue systems" for outcomes |
| "RevOps" vs "revenue operations" | "RevOps" for brevity, spell out on first use | |
| "HubSpot" capitalization | "HubSpot" always | Correct brand capitalization |
| "healthcare" vs "Healthcare" | Lowercase unless starting sentence | |
| "SaaS" vs "B2B SaaS" | "SaaS" for brevity, "B2B SaaS" when clarity needed | |

---

## Phase 7: Final Recommendations

### High Priority (Fix Now)

1. **Standardize primary CTA** to "Book a Strategy Call" everywhere
2. **Fix weak headlines**:
   - Process: "Discovery to launch in 4 stages"
   - Work: "Real numbers from real clients"
   - FAQ: "Questions we hear every week"
3. **Remove "seamless"** from CRM Migration description
4. **Add link to reviews** where "50+ five-star reviews" is mentioned

### Medium Priority (Fix Soon)

5. **Update Contact section headline** from "Ready to transform how you grow?" to "Ready to talk about your revenue?"
6. **Strengthen Services page header** to be more specific
7. **Add proof** for "$4M+ revenue attributed" claim or remove it
8. **Vary "We" sentence starters** in Footer and a few other places

### Low Priority (Polish Pass)

9. **Tighten FAQ answers** - some are longer than necessary
10. **Update generic team headline** on About page
11. **Consider adding client logos** to Client Logos section (currently placeholder)

# Media Garcia CTA & Conversion Optimization

## Executive Summary

This document audits all conversion points on the Media Garcia website and provides optimized CTAs, form recommendations, and a clear conversion strategy.

**Key positioning to maintain:**
- Tech-agnostic RevOps + revenue systems (HubSpot is one capability, not the whole identity)
- Industry focus: Healthcare, IT Services, B2B SaaS
- Primary CTA: "Book a Strategy Call" (establishes expertise, implies value exchange)

## Phase 1: Conversion Audit

### Current Conversion Points Map

| Page | CTA Location | Current CTA Text | Action | Issues |
|------|--------------|------------------|--------|--------|
| **Navigation** | Header (persistent) | "Book a Free Consultation" | → /contact | Generic, doesn't match page CTAs |
| **Homepage** | Hero (above fold) | "Get Your Free Audit" | → #contact | Links to section, not page |
| | Hero secondary | "View Our Work" | → #work | Good secondary |
| | CTABanner (mid-page) | "Get Your Free Audit" | → #contact | Same as hero - consistent |
| | | "Call Us Now" | → tel: | Good secondary |
| | Contact section | "Send Message" | Form submit | Generic button text |
| **Contact Page** | Form | "Send Message" | Form submit | Generic, no urgency |
| | Sidebar | "Book a Meeting with Louis" | → HubSpot meetings | Personal, effective |
| **About Page** | Final CTA | "Start a Conversation" | → /contact | Different from other CTAs |
| | | "Call Us Now" | → tel: | Good secondary |
| **Services Index** | Each card | "Learn more" | → service page | Appropriate contextual |
| | Decision guide CTA | "Book a Discovery Call" | → /contact | Yet another CTA variant |
| | End | CTABanner | | Consistent |
| **Service Detail** (all 9) | FAQ section | "Get in touch" | → /contact | Weak text link |
| | End | CTABanner | | No page-specific CTA |
| **Work (Cases) Index** | Cards | "View Case Study" | → case page | Good contextual |
| | End | CTABanner | | Consistent |
| **Case Study Detail** | End | CTABanner | | No testimonial-adjacent CTA |
| **Industry Pages** (3) | End only | CTABanner | | No inline CTAs |
| **Pricing** | Packages | "Start With Starter" etc. | → /contact | Good package-specific |
| | Custom section | "Get a Custom Quote" | → /contact | Good contextual |
| | End | CTABanner | | Creates redundancy |
| **Assessment** | Form | "Start Assessment" | Form submit | Good action-specific |
| | End | None | | Missing end CTA |

### Conversion Goals Hierarchy

**1. Primary (High-Intent):** Book a Strategy Call
- Target: Prospects ready to discuss their situation
- Action: Schedule a call with Louis/team
- Friction: Low (calendar booking is easy)

**2. Secondary (Medium-Intent):** Get a Free Audit/Assessment
- Target: Prospects evaluating options
- Action: Complete assessment or request audit
- Friction: Medium (requires some effort/info)

**3. Tertiary (Low-Intent):** Explore Services/Work
- Target: Early-stage researchers
- Action: Read case studies, service pages
- Friction: None (content consumption)

### Critical Friction Points Identified

1. **Inconsistent Primary CTA Language**
   - "Book a Free Consultation" (nav)
   - "Get Your Free Audit" (hero, CTABanner)
   - "Book a Discovery Call" (services)
   - "Start a Conversation" (about)
   - This dilutes brand voice and causes confusion

2. **#contact Anchor vs /contact Page**
   - CTABanner links to `#contact` (homepage section)
   - Other CTAs link to `/contact` (dedicated page)
   - Users on other pages get scrolled to homepage, losing context

3. **Weak Form Button Copy**
   - "Send Message" tells user what happens technically, not emotionally
   - No anxiety reduction near submit buttons

4. **Missing Mid-Page CTAs**
   - Service detail pages: No CTA between hero and CTABanner
   - Industry pages: No inline CTAs at all
   - Case studies: No CTA near testimonial (highest trust moment)

5. **CTABanner Placement Issues**
   - Appears at bottom of every page including pricing (which already has CTAs)
   - Missing from assessment page

6. **No Soft Conversion Path**
   - No newsletter, no downloadable resources
   - Forces binary: contact us or leave

## Phase 2: CTA Strategy

### CTA Hierarchy System

#### Primary CTA: "Book a Strategy Call"
**Usage:** One per page, highest visual prominence
**Button style:** Solid black or teal background, white text
**Where it appears:**
- Navigation header (persistent)
- Hero section of key pages
- End of every page (except contact/pricing)

**Copy:**
```
Button: "Book a Strategy Call"
Subtext: "30 minutes. No sales pitch. Just answers."
```

**Why this works:**
- "Strategy" implies expertise and value (not just a sales call)
- "Call" is specific (not vague "consultation")
- Subtext reduces anxiety (time-bound, no pressure)

#### Secondary CTA: "Get Your Free Audit"
**Usage:** Alternative for those not ready to talk
**Button style:** Outline/ghost button
**Where it appears:**
- Hero section (alongside primary)
- CTABanner (as primary there)

**Copy:**
```
Button: "Get Your Free Audit"
Subtext: "See what's working and what's not"
```

#### Contextual CTAs
**Usage:** Relevant to section content
**Button style:** Text link or small button
**Examples:**
- "See how we did it" → case study
- "Explore [Service Name]" → service page
- "Learn more about [Industry]" → industry page

### CTA Copy Principles

**Never use:**
- "Submit" (cold, technical)
- "Learn More" (vague, overused)
- "Click Here" (outdated)
- "Contact Us" (passive, boring)
- "Get in touch" (weak, lowercase energy)

**Always use:**
- Action verb + benefit
- What happens next
- Anxiety reducers

**Formula:** [Action] + [Your/a] + [Benefit/Outcome]

### CTA Placement Rules

1. **Above the fold:** Primary CTA visible without scrolling
2. **After proof:** CTA after testimonials, metrics, or case studies
3. **Mid-page break:** Long pages need a CTA every 2-3 sections
4. **Page end:** Every page ends with CTA section (not just CTABanner)
5. **Contextual opportunities:** After problem statements, after solutions

## Phase 3: Optimized CTAs by Page

```

**Mid-page CTA (after Services section):**

```

---

## Phase 4: Form Optimization

### Primary Contact Form (Homepage & Contact Page)

**Current fields:**
- Name (required)
- Email (required)
- Company (optional)
- Message (required)

**Recommended fields:**
```
- Full Name (required) - single field, not first/last
- Work Email (required)
- Company (required)
- How can we help? (required) - open text
```

**Remove:** Service dropdown (adds friction, they can explain in message)

**Form Design:**
- Single column
- Clear labels above fields
- Inline validation
- Mobile-friendly tap targets
- No captcha visible (use honeypot instead)

### Trust Elements Near Forms

Add these within/near the form:

```
"What happens next?" box:
1. We respond within 24 hours
2. 30-minute discovery call to understand your needs
3. Platform-agnostic recommendation
4. Custom proposal within 1 week

Bottom note: "No spam. No hard sell. Just a conversation about what's possible."
```

### Form Success State

**Current:** Unknown (form doesn't submit to anything yet)

**Recommended Thank You Page content:**
```
Headline: "Thanks, [Name]! We've got your message."

Body: "Here's what happens next:
- You'll receive a confirmation email shortly
- A real person (usually Louis) will review your message
- We'll respond within 24 hours with next steps

In the meantime, explore our work: [Link to /work]

Or if you'd rather talk now: [Phone number]"
```

### Assessment Form

**Current fields are good. Add:**
```
Optional field: "Biggest challenge with your current CRM?" (dropdown)
- Data quality issues
- Low team adoption
- Missing automation
- Poor reporting
- Integration gaps
- Other
```
*This primes them for the assessment questions and helps qualify*

---

## Phase 5: Post-Conversion Flow

### Confirmation Email Content

**Subject:** "Got it! Here's what's next [Name]"

**Body:**
```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for reaching out. We've received your message and someone from our team will be in touch within 24 hours.

Quick note: We're a small team by design. You won't be handed off to junior staff—you'll work directly with senior strategists who've done 200+ implementations.
